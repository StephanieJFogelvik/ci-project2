# Rock Paper Scissors
This interactive online game lets the user play a game of "Rock, Paper, Scissors" against the computer. The game dynamically displays what moves are being played, both by the player and by the computer. There is also a score-keeping section where the user can see how many rounds the user has won, and how many rounds the computer has won. The first to win five games is the winner. Underneath the game, there is an option to be taken back to the Start Page again, where the game rules are listed.

It is a simple game spanning two pages, a Start Page and a Game page.
